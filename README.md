# Beginner Java Projects

Welcome to the **Beginner Java Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of small, beginner-level Java projects that I have worked on to improve my coding skills. Each project demonstrates the use of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and object-oriented programming.

## Projects Included

### 1. **Lottery Game**
   - A simple lottery simulator where users pick numbers and see if they match a randomly generated winning set.
   - **Key concepts used**: Random number generation, arrays, loops.

### 2. **Maps**
   - A basic application that demonstrates the use of Java's `HashMap` to store and retrieve key-value pairs.
   - **Key concepts used**: Java collections, `HashMap`, data structures.

### 3. **Number Guessing Game**
   - The classic number guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly chosen number within a specific range.
   - **Key concepts used**: Input/output, loops, conditionals, random number generation.

### 4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
   - A simple console-based version of the rock-paper-scissors game.
   - **Key concepts used**: Conditional logic, random choices, loops.

### 5. **Tic-Tac-Toe**
   - A console-based two-player game of tic-tac-toe.
   - **Key concepts used**: Arrays, nested loops, game logic.

### 6. **Word Finder**
   - A program that allows users to input text and searches for specific words within the text.
   - **Key concepts used**: String manipulation, loops, searching algorithms.

## How to Run the Projects

Each project can be run individually from the command line or your preferred Java IDE. To run a project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Qoz156/Beginner-Java-Projects.git
2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile and run the Java file(s):

javac ProjectName.java
java ProjectName

Future Improvements
 Add a GUI interface for some of the games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors).
 Include more error handling in the user input.
 Expand functionality for the Word Finder to include more complex search patterns.
